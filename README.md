[00:21.30] Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
[00:29.16] I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
[00:35.81] You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
[00:44.27] Know you're all that I want this life
[01:02.77] 
[00:53.03] I'll imagine we fell in love
[00:55.98] I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[01:00.11] I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[01:04.05] The ocean's colors on your face
[01:08.23] I'll leave my heart with your air
[01:12.91] So let me fly with you
[01:16.76] Will you be forever with me?
[01:30.76] 
[01:57.66] My love will always stay by you
[02:04.15] I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
[02:13.81] It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
[02:21.37] I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you
[02:46.87] 
[02:30.42] I'll imagine we fell in love
[02:33.40] I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[02:37.63] I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[02:41.43] The ocean's colors on your face
[02:45.67] I'll leave my heart with your air
[02:50.39] So let me fly with you
[02:54.10] Will you be forever with me?
